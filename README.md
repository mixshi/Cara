# Cara

Cara is a student project game engine being written in C++, using OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW. It takes after a very basic virtual machine model I saw in a blog a while ago, which got me really interested in virtual machines.

__As of Nov 19, and likely stemming well into the new year of 2025, there is no stable/running version of Cara.__

## The Cara Virtual Machine (CaraVM)
Runs on CVMC (Cara Virtual Machine Code), can execute simple functionality like data manipulation, and can run trap routines for access to OpenGL functionality.

## The Cara Compiler (CaraC)
A compiler for CVMC, I don't yet know for what syntax I'd like it to be compiled from, but I'm thinking something either rust-like, or pythonic.
